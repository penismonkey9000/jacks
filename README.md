# jacks
pp poopoo


this requires three different modules: pynput, time, keyboard
also requires python 3+

if you do not have these modules, go to the prompt and type in
"pip install [module name here]"

can only go up to 40 GJs
didnt make it a loop because i wanted to be able to change each one separately if need be
very wonky program
very fast typing, bubble chat might not show some of it (roblox glitch when something is typed too fast), shows in clogs

starts 5 seconds after running
small .3 delays within different chunks so it won't be too fast

very copy/paste oriented project, i know

now suck me off


feel free to make changes
